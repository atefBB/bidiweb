Introduction:
-------------------

Many web sites have an implicit assumption that text always runs from
left-to-right. This is all fine and dandy as long as all your content is in
English. However, if your webapp is a blog, or generally a platform that
publishes user generated text content, this implicit assumption will cause
problems and grief to users who want to publish content in Arabic, Hebrew,
Persian, or another language that runs from right-to-left.

Luckily the web has already solved the RTL problem; css provides `direction:
rtl`, and all browsers support it. The problem comes when a webapp doesn't
provide a way for users to specify that this or that paragraph should run from
right-to-left. However, they shouldn't have to; it's easy enough for computers
to do that for them. Detecting RTL laguages is a piece of cake, and so is
applying the `direction: rtl` css attribute to any DOM element.

This is what this project is for.

I originally made this so I can use it on my tumblr blog.

Basic Usage:
--------------------

Just call `bidiweb.process('.content')` and it will process all elements that
have a "content" class.

Instead of the text string '.content', you can pass a jQuery object, or
browser-native node object, or generally anything that can be passed to
`jQuery()`.

Yes, jQuery is a pre-requisite.
